# Story Points Forecast and Rationale (Sprint 3)

## Sprint #2: 3/20 - 4/15

### Points Forecast 

* Sprint 3 - Week 1 (3/20/24 - 3/27/24): 8.0 points
* Sprint 3 - Week 2 (3/27/24 - 4/3/24): 8.0 points
* Sprint 3 - Week 3 (4/3/24 - 4/10/24): 8.0 points
* Sprint 3 - Week 4 (4/10/24 - 4/15/24): 6.0 points (only 5 days)

* **Total Sprint 3 Points:** 30.0 points

### Rationale
The rationale for our story points forecast is as follows: In Sprint 1 and 2, our team determined that each individual has the capacity for approximately 2.0 story points of work per week. Since the team was successfully able to maintain that workload throughout the initial two sprints, that estimate was carried over into Sprint 3.

Our typical estimates are to take 2.0 points per team member per week and multiply it by the number of weeks (2.0 x 4 members x 4 weeks = 32.0 total story points). However, since the final "week" of Sprint 3 is only 5 days, we slightly reduced this value down to 30.0 story points.
