# Story Points Forecast and Rationale

## Sprint #1: 1/29 - 2/20

### Points Forecast 

* Sprint 1 - Week 1 (1/29/24 - 2/5/24): 8.0 points
* Sprint 1 - Week 2 (2/5/24 - 2/12/24): 8.0 points
* Sprint 1 - Week 3 (2/12/24 - 2/19/24): 8.0 points

* **Total Sprint 1 Points:** 24.0 points

### Rationale
The rationale for our story points forecast is as follows: Our team has determined that each individual has the capacity for approximately 2.0 story points of work per week. This is based on team member estimates from our scrum planning discussions. 

There are four team members in our group and the sprint is three weeks in duration. 2.0 x 4 members x 3 weeks = 24.0 total story points for Sprint 1.
