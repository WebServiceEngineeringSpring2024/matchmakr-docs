# Story Points Forecast and Rationale (Sprint 2)

## Sprint #2: 2/21 - 3/20

### Points Forecast 

* Sprint 2 - Week 1 (2/21/24 - 2/28/24): 8.0 points
* Sprint 2 - Week 2 (2/28/24 - 3/6/24): 8.0 points
* Sprint 2 - Week 3 (3/6/24 - 3/13/24): 8.0 points
* Sprint 2 - Week 4 (3/13/24 - 3/20/24): 8.0 points

* **Total Sprint 2 Points:** 32.0 points

### Rationale
The rationale for our story points forecast is as follows: In Sprint 1, our team determined that each individual has the capacity for approximately 2.0 story points of work per week. Since the team was successfully able to maintain that workload throughout the initial sprint, that estimate was carried over into Sprint 2.

There are four team members in our group and Sprint 2 is four weeks in duration. 2.0 x 4 members x 4 weeks = 32.0 total story points for Sprint 2.
